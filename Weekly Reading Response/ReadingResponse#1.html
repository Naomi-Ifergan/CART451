Reading Respose #1:

Texts of the week: 

- Catherine D’Ignazio 'Data is never a raw, truthful input – and it is never neutral'  
by Zoe Corbyn
- Programming Collective Intelligence Chapter 1: Introduction to Collective Intelligence by Toby Segaran


Both Corbyn and Segaran’s texts examine data collecting and how the algorithm can improve or worsen a business. More specifically, they discuss the inaccuracy of data through machine learning as it often disregards information that seems unimportant. 

Segaran’s text focuses on ‘collective intelligence’ and the limits of machine learning such as inaccuracy, overgeneralization and limited data finds. Segaran discusses companies that have improved their business using data collecting like Google, Amazon and Netflix. However, machine learning is very restricted and must be improved in order to get more accurate data in the future with ties Corbyn’s text.

Unlike Segaran, Corbyn puts all her attention on what she calls ‘data feminism’ which includes data from all minority groups rather than only collecting general data from majority groups such as white men. Corbyn explains that often times, information is being disregarded by machines and computers which results in research inaccuracy. This typically happens when people of color are unrecognizable to facial analysis softwares. Corbyn argues that data itself is sexist and racist rather than neutral as it’s supposed to be. Lastly, she states that we need more marginalized people to enter the coding world to help solve this issue. However the problem can only be fixed if both people on the inside and outside work together in order to increase data accuracy. With that being said, research methods needs to be diversified by interviewing different people of color, gender, religion, age and so forth to really get the best results.
